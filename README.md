A Gradle plugin for project [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) support.

# Usage
The plugin is included in the [central plugin repository](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/net.franz-becker.gradle-lombok/1.2). 

A minimal `build.gradle` looks like this:

	plugins {
		id 'net.franz-becker.gradle-lombok' version '1.2'
		id 'java'
	}
	
	repositories {
		jcenter() // or Maven central, required for Lombok dependency
	}

	lombok { // optional: values below are the defaults
		version = "1.16.4"
		sha256 = "3ca225ce3917eac8bf4b7d2186845df4e70dcdede356dca8537b6d78a535c91e"
	}


After applying the plugin, the Lombok annotations can be used directly in any Java code and the Lombok Eclipse installer can be called via `gradlew installLombok`.

Some example Java code to get started can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/franzbecker/gradle-lombok/wiki/Lombok-getting-started).


# Motivation

There are two issues this plugin addresses: 

* Adding the dependency to the classpath in a non-intrusive way 
* Simplifying the Eclipse IDE installation

## Adding Lombok dependency

In Maven you would typically do something like this:

	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
			<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
			<version>1.16.4</version>
			<scope>provided</scope>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
	
This will add the Lombok dependency to your project using the `provided` scope. The semantic of this scope is that you expect the JDK or a container to provide the dependency at runtime, which is not really what you want since the dependency is only required at compile time. Since such a scope is not supported by Maven, the `provided` scope is the best approximation.

In Gradle there is no `provided` scope by default. There are plugins addressing this issue such as the excellent [gradle-extra-configurations-plugin](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-extra-configurations-plugin) (which inspired this plugin) that provide this scope, or the `war` plugin with its `providedCompile` scope, but they implement the same semantic as Maven.

What we really want for Lombok is to have a dependency only during compile time. This is provided by this plugin by creating a new scope and applying the Lombok dependency to it. You can easily change the applied version by configuration:

	lombok {
		version = 1.16.4
		sha256 = "3ca225ce3917eac8bf4b7d2186845df4e70dcdede356dca8537b6d78a535c91e"
	}
	
Note that the hash code is only used for the second issue this plugin addresses: the simplification of IDE support.

## Simplifying Eclipse IDE installation

The project Lombok website states:
> NOTE: You'll still need to download lombok, or doubleclick on the lombok.jar file downloaded by maven / ivy / gradle, to install lombok into your eclipse installation.
 
When using Lombok in teams with no automated Eclipse provisioning this is quite a pain. Every developer has to retrieve the JAR, verify its integrity (some won't) and call `java -jar lombok.jar`.

This plugin adds a task called `installLombok` to your Gradle build that uses the dependency that has already been added to the compile-only scope, verifies its integrity using SHA-256 and finally invokes the main class of the JAR. This greatly simplifies the described process for each developer on the team.
